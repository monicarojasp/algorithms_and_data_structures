    "Since I only need to return the duplicate closest to the root, that means the one that appears in the shallowest level of the tree, so I am using a depth-first search (DFS) - Level order traversal approach. \n",

    "The \"is_duplicate\" function takes a root parameter of type TreeNode.This fucntion returns an integer value of the first duplicate found. If no duplicates are found, it returns -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initializes an empty set visited to keep track of visited node values.\n",
    "2. Calls \"find_duplicate\" inner function (root, visited) to initiate the search for duplicates starting from the root node.\n",
    "3. Returns the result of find_duplicate, which is either the first duplicate value found or -1 if no duplicates are found.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inner function \"find_duplicate\" takes the node (current node being examined) and the visited (which is a set that keeps track of values of nodes that have been visited) parameters. This function returns -1 if no duplicates are found in the subtree rooted at node. If a duplicate is found, it returns the value of the duplicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It checks if node is None. If it is, it returns -1, indicating no duplicate found.\n",
    "2. Checks if node.val is already in the visited set. If it is, it returns node.val, indicating a duplicate value found.\n",
    "3. Adds node.val to the visited set to mark it as visited.\n",
    "4. Recursively calls itself (find_duplicate) on the left and right children of node. If a duplicate is found in the left subtree (left_duplicate != -1), it returns the duplicate value. If a duplicate is found in the right subtree (right_duplicate != -1), it returns the duplicate value. If no duplicates are found in both subtrees, it returns -1.\n"

    "1. **TreeNode Class:** \n",
    "Define TreeNode Class that epresent nodes in a binary tree. Each node has a value (val) and pointers to left and right children (left and right).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. from collections import the deque function \n",

    "4. Iteration: The function enter a while loop that continues as long as queue is not empty.\n",
    "5. Dequeue Operation: use queue.popleft() to remove and return the leftmost node from the deque, node, simulating the behavior of a queue where the oldest added node is processed first (FIFO).\n",
    "6. Duplicate Check: create a conditional that checks if node.val (the value of the current node) is already in the visited set. If it is, this means a duplicate value has been found, so the function returns node.val.\n",
    "7. Mark as Visited: Adds the value of the node (node.val) to the visited set to mark it as visited and prevent re-processing.\n",
    "8. Enqueue Children: create a conditional to check if node has a left child (node.left), then add it to the back of queue using queue.append(node.left). Similarly, create a condition to check if node has a right child (node.right), then add it to the back of queue using queue.append(node.right).\n",
    "9. Finally if the while loop completes without finding any duplicates (queue becomes empty), the function returns -1 indicating that no duplicates were found in the tree.\n",
