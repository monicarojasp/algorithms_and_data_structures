    "The assignments on algorithms and data structures were very useful to apply what we learned during our discussion sessions. In my case, assignment 1 involved implementing the is_duplicate function to detect duplicate values in a binary tree. To optimize the function's efficiency in terms of time and space, I focused on processing only essential information. Given that the task required identifying any duplicate closer to the root, I returned only the first duplicate found by the function. By using recursion and the 'visited' set, I was making sure that each node was processed exactly once, allowing me to effectively detect duplicates across various levels of the tree.\n",

    "By analyzing my partner's assignment provided insights into how different methods can impact time and space complexities. These exercises underscored the critical role of selecting appropriate data structures such as lists, sets, and binary trees tailored to specific problem requirements and algorithms. Through practical application, I gained a deeper understanding of fundamental concepts covered in our coursework.\n",
